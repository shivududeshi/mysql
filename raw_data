far, we are creating one custom composite `MPI_Datatype` for each `MPI_Isend` to transfer variably-sized commands and buffer subranges. For reasons not investigated further, this yields abysmal performance at least on IBM Spectrum MPI.\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces those single-use MPI datatypes with a serialization into _frames_, contiguous `struct`s with a zero-sized array as the last member, a common idiom for typing a header together with variably-sized data. These are sent and received over MPI as simple byte streams. The smart pointer type `unique_frame_ptr` is introduced to allocate and manage frame types with arbitrary, variably-sized payloads.\r\n\r\nAs a downside, this change adds a semantically unnecessary allocation and copy of incoming buffer transfers: MPI receives `data_frame`s, whereas the buffer manager keeps uncommitted transfers as `raw_buffer_data`. This might be noticeable for very large transfers. The solution is likely to get rid of the owning `raw_buffer_data` altogehter, but this will affect a lot of code, so it should be addressed in a follow-up PR.","created_at":"2022-04-22T16:54:38Z","updated_at":"2022-05-05T12:51:54Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8c7da55487c40f306ec208f106bcd8336ac9d42e","assignee":{"login":"fknorr","id":5698527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2OTg1Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5698527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fknorr","html_url":"https://github.com/fknorr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fknorr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fknorr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fknorr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fknorr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fknorr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fknorr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fknorr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fknorr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fknorr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"fknorr","id":5698527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2OTg1Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5698527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fknorr","html_url":"https://github.com/fknorr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fknorr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fknorr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fknorr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fknorr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fknorr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fknorr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fknorr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fknorr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fknorr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"psalz","id":791348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MTM0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/791348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalz","html_url":"https://github.com/psalz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},{"login":"PeterTh","id":1033475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzM0NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1033475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterTh","html_url":"https://github.com/PeterTh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterTh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterTh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterTh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterTh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterTh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterTh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterTh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterTh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PeterTh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/celerity/celerity-runtime/pulls/114/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/celerity/celerity-runtime/pulls/114/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/celerity/celerity-runtime/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/celerity/celerity-runtime/issues/114/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/celerity/celerity-runtime/statuses/3a612f3f88b2c0c66f16bdb0a7a95b406d2749f6","head":{"label":"celerity:data-frames","ref":"data-frames","sha":"3a612f3f88b2c0c66f16bdb0a7a95b406d2749f6","user":{"login":"celerity","id":44203412,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ0MjAzNDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44203412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/celerity","html_url":"https://github.com/celerity","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celerity/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celerity/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celerity/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/celerity/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://

§10.4 of the Core 4.6 spec, with regards to DrawElementsOneInstance, we have\r\n\r\n> The vertex ID of the ith element transferred is the sum of basevertex and the value stored in the currently bound element array buffer at offset indices + i\r\n\r\nAs defined in §10.3.10 (which subsequently defers to §10.3.9), offsets are expressed in basic machine units; we note this is consistent with the passing of `cmd->firstIndex * size-of-type` as `indices` to DrawElementsInstancedBaseVertexBaseInstance in the definition of DrawElementsIndirect.\r\n\r\nReturning to DrawElementsOneInstance, the correct offset to apply to the element array buffer is therefore not `indices + i` but `indices + i * size-of-type`, since the former fails (in practice) if `type` is not `UNSIGNED_BYTE`. This appears to be a slip introduced in the spec for 4.3, prior to which `indices[i]` was meaningful (if subtly questionable since it is formally `void*`, not `type*`):\r\n\r\n> The ith element transferred by DrawElementsOneInstance will be taken from element indices[i] of each enabled non-instanced array.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/KhronosGroup/OpenGL-API/issues/85/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/KhronosGroup/OpenGL-API/issues/85/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-05-05T12:51:54Z","org":{"id":1608701,"login":"KhronosGroup","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/KhronosGroup","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1608701?"}},{"id":"21634188809","type":"CreateEvent","actor":{"id":104989518,"login":"Yashkadluva","display_login":"Yashkadluva","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yashkadluva","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104989518?"},"repo":{"id":488971110,"name":"Yashkadluva/CRUD_form_js","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Yashkadluva/CRUD_form_js"},"payload":{"ref":null,"ref_type":"repository","master_branch":"main","description":null,"pusher_type":"user"},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-05-05T12:51:54Z"},{"id":"21634188784","type":"PullRequestEvent","actor":{"id":18253191,"login":"franmavazq","display_login":"franmavazq","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/franmavazq","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18253191?"},"repo":{"id":302441463,"name":"iHub-PTI/boldo-web","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iHub-PTI/boldo-web"},"payload":{"action":"opened","number":40,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iHub-PTI/boldo-web/pulls/40","id":928660010,"node_id":"PR_kwDOEgbj9843Wjoq","html_url":"https://github.com/iHub-PTI/boldo-web/pull/40","diff_url":"https://github.com/iHub-PTI/boldo-web/pull/40.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/iHub-PTI/boldo-web/pull/40.patch","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iHub-PTI/boldo-web/issues/40","number":40,"state":"open","locked":false,"title":"fix:
